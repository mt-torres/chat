## :pencil:Description
This application is an instant chat developed using Socket.io and Node.js.

On the main screen, you need to provide your name and the room you want to join.

On the chat screen, you can see the number of available users and their names.

Whenever there is any update, all users in the same room will be notified.

Due to limitations of free hosting services, it was necessary to separate the socket. The code for the Socket API can be found <a href="https://github.com/mt-torres/chat-websocket-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>

The socket server was deployed on the Render platform, and the application was deployed on Vercel.

Please, click <a href="https://chat-kappa-one-60.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to access the application.

## :dart: Goals
My goal was to deepen my knowledge of Node.js and learn how Socket.io works.
